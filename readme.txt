The JupyterLab start/stop scripts are in the jupyterlab Git repo (current directory).
The JupyterLab settings are saved/loaded to/from the .jupyter directory in the home
directory of user 'rbrecheisen'. Currently, JupyterLab is setup to work with password
authentication. When you restart the container, the password setting should be pre-
served.
